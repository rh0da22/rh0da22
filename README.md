# Welcome to my profile ðŸ˜„!

### My name is Rhoda and I am currently enrolled in a data science bootcamp, so I will be uploading projects that I work on often. You can also find my portfolio [here](https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/RD23100009805/). In this bootcamp I am learning mainly to code in python and our current focus is NLP which I am excited about.

### My goal is to land a graduate/junior role as a data scientist / analyst!

### If you want to reach me my email is **rhoda.durodola@yahoo.com**.
